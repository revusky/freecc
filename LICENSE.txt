JavaCC, the software program from which FreeCC is originally derived, was 
made available by Sun Microsystems under a BSD-style license. The FreeCC 
source code is also available under pretty much identical terms. Basically,
the changes to the license amount to adding in a reference to the Visigoth 
Software Society in addition to Sun Microsystems.

The Visigoth Software Society was originally a not-for-profit association currently made up of 3 members: Jonathan Revusky, Attila Szegedi, and Daniel Dekany. VSS was formed in 2003 for the development of FreeMarker. The name "Visigoth Software Society" was chosen for the sole reason that it sounds cool.

No inferences regarding the political, philosophical, or cultural leanings of its members should be drawn from it. In any case, VSS, to all intents and purposes does not really exist. The FreeCC fork, as of this writing, is entirely the fault of Jonathan Revusky, who makes this work available under the generous terms of BSD-style license, that you can do what you want with it as long as you retain the copyright/license info and acknowledge that you are using it.

Note also that these license terms refer to the source code of the FreeCC tool itself. Any code that users generate using the tool belongs to them alone and is completely unencumbered.
