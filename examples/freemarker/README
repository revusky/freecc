This directory contains a grammar for the FreeMarker template
language.  Note that this grammar is not the one used in FreeMarker
itself. However, the intention is for this grammar to supplant the
existing (very crufty one) in the coming FreeMarker 2.4.x release
cycle. Note that there are actually two separate grammars, FEL.freecc
and FTL.freecc. FEL stands for FreeMarker Expression Language and the
intention is for this to become a useful standalone component. The
full FTL grammar simply INCLUDE's the FEL grammar.

To test the FEL grammar, simply cd into the FEL directory, and execute:

freecc FEL.freecc

t the command prompt. After that, do:

javac fel/*.java

and you should be able to test the parser via:

java fel.FELParser

You can then type an expression and it will dump the parse tree that it builds.
For example, try typing 2+2 and then press ENTER, and then Ctrl-D to indicate the end of your input.

Feel free to experiment with more complex expressions.
